# Income Evaluation Machine Learning Project
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting income levels based on various features. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into different income brackets, facilitating targeted financial analysis and decision-making.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about individuals, including demographic details, education, occupation, and other relevant features. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and any outliers that may affect model performance.

## Models
Multiple machine learning models are explored and implemented, including but not limited to:
  -Gradient Boosting
  -Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  -Naive Bayes
  -Logistic Regression
Model selection is based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the models' capabilities.
